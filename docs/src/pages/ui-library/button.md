Button is a component that is included in the `@astro-auth/ui` library and it looks exactly similar to the buttons in the [astro.build](https://astro.build) official website.

You can use the button like this,

```jsx
import { Button } from "@astro-auth/ui";

const ButtonSection = () => {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
};
```
