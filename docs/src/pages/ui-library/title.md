Title is a component that is included in the `@astro-auth/ui` library and it looks exactly similar to the title text in the [astro.build](https://astro.build) official website.

You can use the title like this,

```jsx
import { Title } from "@astro-auth/ui";

const TitleSection = () => {
  return <Title>Click Me</Title>;
};
```
